# ParallelChain Testnet

## What is Testnet
---
To ensure the new features in ParallelChain Mainnet have what it takes to survive decentralized deployment, they must first be battle-tested. This is where ParallelChain Testnet comes into play by allowing developers, or simply users, to develop and run smart contracts or transactions on ParallelChain and experiment with the blockchain, at no cost.

The current testnet iteration delivers on Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, the cornerstone of security in ParallelChain's proof-of-stake network. Besides this, Testnet 4 delivers big leaps in the contract SDK and developer experience, as well as a web Wallet.
Both Mainnet and Testnet are accessible through Explorer.

## How to Access
---

Similar to accessing the Mainnet, you can access and interact with the Testnet with:

- The command-line tool `pchain-client`. *For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the [Getting started](../getting_started/prepare_env.md#setting-endpoint-interacting-with-parallelchain) section to setup the `pchain-client` for Testnet.*
- [ParallelChain Explorer](https://explorer.parallelchain.io/explorer). *The explorer supports both Mainnet and Testnet. Please switch to testnet by selecting 'Testnet' from the drop down list on the top left corner of the Explorer.*

## Generating a Testnet Account
---
The way to create a Testnet account is the same as creating one for Mainnet:

- Using **ParallelChain Client (pchain-client)**.
*Please refer to [Getting Started](../getting_started/create_account.md#generating-keypair) part to install and set up `pchain_client` and create a Testnet account.*

- Using **ParallelChain Explorer**.
*Please refer to the [Explorer Account Tutorial](https://parallelchain.io/company/newsroom/explorer-account-tutorial) to generate a Testnet account, which follows the same process as generating a Mainnet account, but with Testnet Explorer.*

## Getting Testnet Tokens
---
The faucet service of our Testnet issues free testing tokens to users to test the blockchain network on Testnet. The service is available on [Explorer Faucet](https://faucet.parallelchain.io), please follow the instructions to proceed.
