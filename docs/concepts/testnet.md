## What is Testnet
---
To ensure the new features in ParallelChain Mainnet have what it takes to survive decentralised deployment, they must first be battle-tested. This is where ParallelChain Testnet comes into play by allowing developers, or simply users, to develop and run smart contracts or transactions on ParallelChain and experiment with the blockchain, at no cost.

The current testnet iteration delivers on Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, the cornerstone of security in ParallelChain's proof-of-stake network. Besides this, Testnet 4 delivers big leaps in the contract SDK and developer experience, as well as a web Wallet.
Both Mainnet and Testnet are accessible through Explorer.
