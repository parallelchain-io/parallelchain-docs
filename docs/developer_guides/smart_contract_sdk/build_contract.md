# Building the Contract with pchain_compile

**pchain_compile** is a CLI build tool for smart contract developers to build their source code to WASM binaries for deployment on 
ParallelChain Mainnet. 

The WASM binary generated from a generic cargo build process has the following disadvantages: 
  
  - The build process is not toolchain version agnostic i.e. it does not guarantee uniform WASM binaries with different versions of compiler and 
    rust crate dependencies. This will make it difficult for smart contract developers to verify their source code on the blockchain.
  
  - The build process generates a large file size, which leads to higher gas costs for deployment and contract calls.

**pchain_compile** solves these shortcomings by: 

  - Executing the build process in a docker environment with pre-defined toolchain versioning.
  
  - Optimizing and compressing the size of the WASM binary with the help of `wasm-snip` and `wasm-opt` packages.


## Downloading **pchain_compile**
---

`pchain_compile` supports Linux, macOS and Windows. Depending on the operating system, they can be downloaded from Assets of ParallelChain Lab's Git Hub [release page](https://github.com/parallelchain-io/pchain-compile/releases).

The binary can also be installed and built by executing the following commands:
```
cargo install pchain_compile
```

!!! Pre-Requisites
    `pchain_compile` builds the source code in a docker environment. To know more about Docker and install it, refer to the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).



## Build WASM Binary
---

In order to build a `WASM` binary of the smart contract, run the following command:

=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_compile build --source <PATH_TO_SMART_CONTRACT_CODE>
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_compile.exe build --source <PATH_TO_SMART_CONTRACT_CODE>
    ```

If you installed `pchain_compile` with `cargo install`, you can simply run:

```
pchain_compile build --source <PATH_TO_SMART_CONTRACT_CODE>
```

A `.wasm` file will be generated in the current directory. It will be needed for the [next section](./deploy_contract.md).
