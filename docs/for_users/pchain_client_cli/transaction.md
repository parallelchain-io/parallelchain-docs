## Transaction 

A transaction is a digitally signed instruction that tells the ParallelChain state machine to execute a sequence of commands. There are different kinds of [Commands](https://docs.rs/pchain-types/0.4.3/pchain_types/blockchain/enum.Command.html) in ParallelChain protocol. 

`pchain_client` accepts transaction in json format. This section will demonstrate how to prepare your transaction file and submit it with your account keys.
### Prepare Transaction File
`pchain_client` provides user-friendly way to prepare your transaction file without prior knowledge of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
The transaction file consists of 2 parts: `Parameters` and `Subcommand`.

Here are some CLI subcommands to indicate corresponding Protocol Transaction Command. 

| Subcommand | Action          | Description                                           |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| transfer   |                 | Transfer balance from transaction signer to recipient |
| deploy     |                 | Deploy smart contract to the state of the blockchain  |
| call       |                 | Trigger method call of a deployed smart contract      |
| deposit    |                 | Deposit some balance into the network account         |
|            | create          | Instantiation of a Deposit of an existing Pool        |
|            | top-up          | Increase balance of an existing Deposit               |
|            | withdraw        | Withdraw balance from an existing Deposit             |
|            | update-settings | Update settings of an existing Deposit                |
| stake      |                 | Stake to a particular pool                            |
|            | stake           | Increase stakes to an existing Pool                   |
|            | unstake         | Remove stakes from an existing Pool                   |
| pool       |                 | Create and manage Pool                                |
|            | create          | Instantiation of a Pool in the network account        |
|            | update-settings | Update settings of an existing Pool                   |
|            | delete          | Delete an existing Pool in the network account        |

### Create New Transaction File
`Transaction` in ParallelChain protocol specifies a set of parameters included in the instruction. You don't need to provide all parameters, some of them would be computed and filled in automatically when you submit the transaction.

=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction create --help
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction create --help
    ```


First, provide the following 4 parameters:
=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction create \
      --nonce <NONCE> \
      --gas-limit <GAS_LIMIT> \
      --max-base-fee-per-gas <MAX_BASE_FEE_PER_GAS> \
      --priority-fee-per-gas <PRIORITY_FEE_PER_GAS> \
    ...
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction create `
      --nonce <NONCE> `
      --gas-limit <GAS_LIMIT> `
      --max-base-fee-per-gas <MAX_BASE_FEE_PER_GAS> `
      --priority-fee-per-gas <PRIORITY_FEE_PER_GAS> `
    ...
    ```

Then, decide the transaction type using the [CLI subcommand](#prepare-transaction-file). Each of them takes different inputs. You can always check the help menu using `--help`.

Make sure you provide both `Parameters` and `Subcommand` parts in one command. The output transaction file (tx.json) will be saved in the current directory. You can also specify the designated file with the flag `--destination`

Example - Transfer tokens:
=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction create \
      --nonce 0 \
      --gas-limit 100000 \
      --max-base-fee-per-gas 8 \
      --priority-fee-per-gas 0 \
      transfer \
        --recipient kRPL8cXI73DNgVSSQz9WfIi-mAAvFvdXKfZ9UPBEv_A \
        --amount 100
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction create `
      --nonce 0 `
      --gas-limit 100000 `
      --max-base-fee-per-gas 8 `
      --priority-fee-per-gas 0 `
      transfer `
        --recipient kRPL8cXI73DNgVSSQz9WfIi-mAAvFvdXKfZ9UPBEv_A `
        --amount 100
    ```

Example - Deploy contract and save to designated file `deposit-tx.json`:
=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction create \
    --destination ~/Documents/deposit-tx.json \
    --nonce 0 \
    --gas-limit 100000 \
    --max-base-fee-per-gas 8 \
    --priority-fee-per-gas 0 \
    deploy \
      --contract-code /home/document/code.wasm \
      --cbi-version 0
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction create `
    --destination ~/Documents/deposit-tx.json `
    --nonce 0 `
    --gas-limit 100000 `
    --max-base-fee-per-gas 8 `
    --priority-fee-per-gas 0 `
    deploy `
      --contract-code /home/document/code.wasm `
      --cbi-version 0
    ```


### Append Command to Existing File
As explained in the beginning of [Transaction](#transaction) section, Transaction in ParallelChain protocol accepts sequence of commands. But you may find that `transaction create` in previous section only support a single Command in Transaction. 

If you want to support multiple Commands, use the following command with the [subcommand](#prepare-transaction-file). This appends a `Command` element to the back of the command array in Transaction. Please note that commands in array will be executed in sequential order.

Example:
=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction append \
    --file ~/Documents/deposit-tx.json \
    transfer \
      --recipient kRPL8cXI73DNgVSSQz9WfIi-mAAvFvdXKfZ9UPBEv_A \
      --amount 100
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction append `
    --file ~/Documents/deposit-tx.json `
    transfer `
      --recipient kRPL8cXI73DNgVSSQz9WfIi-mAAvFvdXKfZ9UPBEv_A `
      --amount 100
    ```

### Submit Transaction to ParallelChain
After preparing the transaction json file, you can now submit the transaction with keypair.

Example:

=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```bash
    ./pchain_client transaction submit \
    --file <FILE> \
    --keypair-name <KEYPAIR_NAME>
    ```
=== "Windows PowerShell"
    ```PowerShell
    ./pchain_client.exe transaction submit `
    --file <FILE> `
    --keypair-name <KEYPAIR_NAME>
    ```

You will get a response like the following example if the transaction is accepted by your provider.
```sh
{
  "API Response:": "Your Transaction has been received.",
  "Command(s):": [
    {
      "Deploy":
      {
        "cbi_version": 0,
        "contract": "<contract in 53476 bytes>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "Contract Address:": "EH-0Im5Pb5mZQumIP6AAxyqTU7fBWQsNfLdGfaBh8AE",
  "Signature:": "DdRr2l-f3SwWtQP7M5JKdOUEvIb-th2mBrV1z06dkvB2rpp0qKQZwBBzJBh8czCqplUsmzSlSjPNrvOQbx2jAA",
  "Transaction Hash:": "POikFlLT8sVuVt3RHJvxmzPKP8dfvi55TrME6Muc80I"
}
```
