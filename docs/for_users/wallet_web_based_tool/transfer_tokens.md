1. Access the blockchain explorer via explorer.parallelchain.io, or click on the **EXPLORER** button on the [ParallelChain homepage](https://parallelchain.io/).
2. To log in, click on the *round* icon on the top right hand corner of the webpage and enter your password.
3. Press the **VERIFY** button.
4. If you do not remember your password, you can choose to log in with your recovery key. Once you have access to your account, you should set a new password through your wallet settings.
5. Once you are verified, you can access your wallet account.


### Step 2: Send Tokens To Another Address


1. Click the **SEND** button below the display that shows your XPLL balance.

2. Enter the address that you want to send XPLL tokens to in the **To Address** field. If you are transferring tokens between your own accounts internally, you can copy the address of the receiving account by clicking the **COPY** icon beside its address.
3. Next, go back to the wallet's main interface and press the **SEND** button located beside the **STAKE** button.
4. Paste the receiving address in the **To Address** field, and enter the amount of XPLL tokens you would like to send in the **Send** field. The amount must not be a negative number, and it cannot exceed the amount of tokens you currently have. Press **NEXT** once you have entered the amount.
5. The following fields will appear:
    - **Nonce**: This field will be automatically populated for you.
    - **Max Base Fee per Gas**: This field will be automatically populated for you based on the current Base Fee per Gas of the network.
    - **Priority Fee per Gas**: This determines the priority of your transaction, and the minimum fee is 0 XPLL.
    - **Gas Limit**: This field will be automatically populated for you.
6. Once you are satisfied with the populated fields, press **NEXT** at the bottom.


### Step 3: Confirm Your Transaction Details

2. The status of the token deposit will be shown as **PENDING**. When it is validated by the network, **SUCCESS** will be shown under its status tab.
3. You may review your transaction details again by selecting the **TRANSACTIONS** tab on the main page of the account, then select the listed transaction.
