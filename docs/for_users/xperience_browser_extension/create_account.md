!!! note
    This process is the same on Xperience Browser Extension as it is on ParallelChain Explorer. 

**Xperience Browser Extension** is browser extension of your ParellelChain Explorer Wallet.

To conduct transactions on ParallelChain Mainnet you will first need to create an account on the blockchain to access the network. Accounts are free to create, and they can be set up through **Xperience Browser Extension**—or through the good old **ParallelChain Explorer**.

The blockchain account you create on ParallelChain is non-custodial, which means only you have control and access to it. You must store your recovery key securely and properly to avoid losing access to your assets. There is no way to retrieve it if it is lost. 

Learn how to create and manage your ParallelChain account using **Xperience Browser Extension** with the steps below. 

 

## Install **Xperience Browser Exension**

For Chrome users, install the extension via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xperience-browser-extensi/gpfllmjckejjhmmdmgbgmclmhopekjpf). The extension currently only works on Chrome.

## FAQ

### Is the wallet in Xperience Browser Extension the same as the wallet in ParallelChain Explorer?

Yes, they are the same. You can access your wallet through either **Xperience Browser Extension** or **ParallelChain Explorer**.

---

### Is my Xperience Browser Extension the same as my ParallelChain account?

No, they are not the same. Your ParallelChain account is the keypair registered on the **ParallelChain Mainnet**, and the Xperience browser extension is simply a platform that connects you to your ParallelChain account. You can access your ParallelChain account as long as you have your keypair, even if you lose the device the Xperience Browser Extension is installed on.

---

### Can I send XPLL tokens to other blockchains like Ethereum?

No, you cannot send XPLL tokens to other blockchains at the moment. XPLL and other PRFC tokens are currently only compatible with the ParallelChain Mainnet network, and sending your tokens to other network addresses will lose your tokens.

---

### What happens if I lose both my recovery key and password?

Xperience is a non-custodial wallet that only you have access to. If you lose your recovery key and password, you will lose access to your wallet. We recommend that you write down your recovery key and store it in a secure place.

If you have lost access to your existing wallet, you can opt to register for a new wallet by clearing the cache of your current browser, and then refreshing the page. Please check with your selected browser to find out how to clear your browser cache.
After that, register for a new wallet by following the steps under [Register for a New Wallet](#register-for-a-new-wallet).

If you have exported your public and private keys before, you can then recover access to your assets by importing your old account with its public and private keys. For more details, follow the steps under [Exporting Account](#exporting-account) and [Importing Account](#importing-account).

---

### Where can I seek support or report bugs?

You can visit ParallelChain's [Discord](https://discord.gg/parallelchainofficial) for community help. If you cannot resolve your issue there, you can write to [walletsupport@parallelchain.io](mailto:walletsupport@parallelchain.io).
