**Xperience** is your ParallelChain wallet, and **ParallelChain Explorer** is a web-based tool that allows you to access your wallet.
 
To conduct transactions on ParallelChain Mainnet you will first need to create an account on the blockchain to access the network. Accounts are free to create, and they can be set up through **ParallelChain Explorer**—or through the new **Xperience Browser Extension**.
 
The blockchain account you create on ParallelChain is non-custodial, which means only you have control and access to it. You must store your recovery key securely and properly to avoid losing access to your assets. There is no way to retrieve it if it is lost.
 
Learn how to create and manage your ParallelChain account using **ParallelChain Explorer** with the steps below.

## FAQ 
---

### Are my ParallelChain wallet and account the same thing?

No, your wallet and your account are not the same. Your account is registered on ParallelChain Mainnet, and your wallet extension helps connect you to your account. This means you are able to recover your account should you lose the device that your wallet extension is installed.


### What kind of digital assets can I store in my Xperience account?

Currently, it can store XPLL. In the near future, you will be able to store other ParallelChain-based cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).


### Can I send XPLL tokens to other blockchains like Ethereum?

No, you cannot send XPLL tokens to other blockchains at the moment. XPLL and other PRFC tokens currently only exist on ParallelChain Mainnet network, and sending your tokens to other network addresses will cause you to lose your tokens.
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility is targeted to come with the Lamport epoch as part of the [development roadmap](https://parallelchain.io/roadmap).



### What happens if I lose my recovery key and password?

Xperience is a non-custodial wallet which only you have the access to. If you lose your recovery key and password, you will lose access to any asset that is stored in it. We recommend that you write down your recovery key and store it in a secure place, or follow the steps under Exporting Your Account With Public & Private Keys.


If you have lost access to your existing account, you can opt to create a new account by clearing the cache of your current browser, then refreshing the page. After that, create a new account by following the steps under [Creating Your ParallelChain Mainnet Account](#create). Please check online to find out how you can clear your respective browser caches.


### Are Xperience and Parallel wallet different?
Yes, Xperience and ParallelWallet are two different types of non-custodial wallets. You can store XPLL on both wallets, but the recovery keys are not interchangeable and you should still store them in a secure manner.

### Is the wallet in Xperience Browser Extension the same as the wallet in ParallelChain Explorer?
