## ParallelChain Mainnet

**ParallelChain Mainnet** is a high-performance blockchain designed for enterprise-level use cases. It provides a platform for developers to build decentralised applications (dApps) with its efficient smart contract execution engine.

It is designed to balance high performance and genuine decentralization. It is protected by the ParallelBFT consensus protocol, which adopts a sophisticated class-based node system to ensure fast and accountable consensus.

For more information about the consensus protocol, please read the section [Consensus Mechanism](./consensus_mechanism.md).

## ParallelChain Testnet

To ensure the new features in ParallelChain Mainnet have what it takes to survive decentralised deployment, they must first be battle-tested. This is where ParallelChain Testnet comes into play by allowing developers, or simply users, to develop and run smart contracts or transactions on ParallelChain and experiment with the blockchain, at no cost.

The current testnet iteration delivers on Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, the cornerstone of security in ParallelChain's proof-of-stake network. Besides this, Testnet 4 delivers big leaps in the contract SDK and developer experience, as well as a web Wallet.
Both Mainnet and Testnet are accessible through Explorer.
