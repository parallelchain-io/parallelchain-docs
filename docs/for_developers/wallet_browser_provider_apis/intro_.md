# ParallelChain Wallet Extension

ParallelChain Wallet Extension is a browser extension that allows you to integrate your [dapp](./definition.md#provider) with [ParallelChain Wallet](../../concepts/wallet.md).

This enables your dapp to interact with your dapp users' XPLL accounts, to:

- Send [transactions](../../concepts/transaction.md#transaction)
  - [Stake](../../concepts/staking/what_is_staking.md) XPLL
- Trigger confirmation for [smart contract](../../concepts/smartcontract.md) calls 

Start by reading about the [ParallelChain Wallet Provider API](./provider/intro.md).

## FAQ

### After installing the extension, I am still not able to access `window.xpll` in my browser or dapp.

Try refreshing the webpage and make sure the website is a valid http or https website. Restricted sites like `chrome://extensions/` or `about:debugging` will not be able to access the injected API.

### After clicking the extension icon, nothing happens.

If this is your first time setting up the wallet, a separate notification window will appear. If you are using multiple screens, check if the notification window has appeared on another screen.
