# Preparing Environment

You have the the tools to develop smart contracts. You also need the environment to deploy and call your smart contracts. You can utilize the [Mainnet](../../fundamentals/networks.md#parallelchain-mainnet) as a production environment for your business application, as well as the [Testnet](..//../fundamentals/networks.md#parallelchain-testnet) as a testing environment before deploying your release to Mainnet.

## Checking the Network

You can check the [**Mainnet**](../../fundamentals/networks.md#parallelchain-mainnet) by viewing the ParallelChain Explorer:

* [ParallelChain Mainnet Explorer](https://explorer.parallelchain.io/explorer) 

The explorer can explore transactions, addresses, information about the network, and blocks.

To verify that [**Testnet**](../../fundamentals/networks.md#parallelchain-testnet) is alive:

* [https://pchain-test-rpc02.parallelchain.io](https://pchain-test-rpc02.parallelchain.io)

You can use [ParallelChain Client CLI](../../for_users/pchain_client_cli/introduction.md) (called `pchain_client`) to interact with the `Testnet` node.

## Setting Up ParallelChain Client CLI

Before we start developing the smart contracts, the `pchain_client` executable needs to be configured.

If you are not yet familiar with `pchain_client`, See [Install and Setup](../../for_users/pchain_client_cli/install_and_setup.md) to install `pchain_client` and learn about the basic functionalities before proceeding with smart contract development.
