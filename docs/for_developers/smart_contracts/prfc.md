# ParallelChain Request for Comments (PRFC)

PRFC (ParallelChain Request for Comments) defines application layer standards which specifies common interface of ParallelChain Smart Contract and its state representation so that applications running on ParallelChain can interact with for a well-defined purpose.

The number suffix is identified as each standardâ€™s unique ID. At the time of writing, there have been 3 PRFCs proposed: PRFC1 defines a standard interface for fungible tokens, and PRFC2 for non-fungible tokens (similar meanings as ERC20 and ERC721 in Ethereum).

You can find all PRFCs in this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/parallelchain-io/prfcs](https://github.com/parallelchain-io/prfcs). Please feel free to leave your comments or submit proposals on the Issues page.
